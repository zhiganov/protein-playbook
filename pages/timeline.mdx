# Timeline

Each of the Protein Projects Components will have different timelines: 

## Briefs

at the beginning of each season the Core Team issues three briefs for the community to tackle. 

Each project will have a specific time window during which will need to be delivered. This time window could be a whole season or a few weeks depending on the project. 

## Ideas

At the beginning of each season, we will host a workshop around our seasonal theme that will kick start the ideation phase. After the ideation phase, during which founders and contributors will form teams, there will be a scoping phase followed by the evaluation of the grants committee. After the announcement of the grants, the funded projects will have 6 weeks to work before handing over their latest status to the Seasonal Report team.
