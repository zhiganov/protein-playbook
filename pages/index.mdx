# Welcome to Protein Projects

Season 4 and Season 5 are the seasons during which we have been piloting a new framework to empower our community, Protein Projects.

## Season 4: From a team centric to an project-centric structure

With season 4, we announced 2 major updates to our community: 

1. our very own merge, bringing into the same picture community, agency, and studios.
2. an organizational restructuring that would shift the Protein community from a team-centric to an project-centric structure.

**Protein is a place to make people and ideas grow.**

For this reason, we created a grants program in the Project-Ideas Forum in our Discord. A place where any members can pitch an idea, and any member can either show support for the idea ‚ûï or the will to contribute üñêÔ∏è. This first experiment created a lot of energy and momentum, we saw discussions firing up, and had a few projects applying for and winning grants. 

## Season 5: From a seasonal input to a seasonal output

Looking back at what Protein Projects achieved in season 4, we wanted to continue tweaking the model and focus on concrete outputs.

We want our projects to be impactful and generate actual results. We want Protein Projects to be a rewarding experience for the members of the community and, at the same time, generate value for the wider ecosystem.

To reach this, we introduced a general prompt for all community initiatives, a seasonal theme and a final output, a seasonal report in which all the seasons initiatives including Protein Projects will be feeding into. 

**The seasonal theme (Input):** 

The seasonal theme is decided among core members of the Protein ecosystem. It is originated in the dirty world forum and it will influence all the Protein community initiatives: 

- supplement
- stories of growth
- Protein Projects
- [Dirty words](https://discord.com/channels/796712320565772301/1047848474378522716)

**The seasonal report (output):** 

The Protein community initiatives can be consolidated in a report, a new type of deliverable that can increase the credibility and value of the Protein Community.
