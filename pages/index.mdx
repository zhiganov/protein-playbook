# Protein Playbook

**Protein Projects** is an initiative that caters to founders and contributors. We believe that people can unite around ideas and Protein Projects is a space to cultivate ideas and the relationships that they might generate. 

Protein projects offers two types of guardrails for creators and builders. 

- Core team briefs (in collab with Core Team + Grants Committee)
    
    The Core Team defines briefs that generate impact for Protein.
    (ie. make our members directory happen)
    
- Project Cycles (in collab with Grants committee)
    
    Cycles are frameworks during which the community can work on a shared theme that ties to the seasonal objective. The Cycles theme aim at generating culture, connection. 
    Every season has 2 cycles and every cycle has the following phases: 
    
    - Theme announcement
    - Ideation
    - Scoping
    - Evaluation
    - Funding or archival
