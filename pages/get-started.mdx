# Guidelines

import Callout from 'nextra-theme-docs/callout'

Protein Projects consists of two main components: Briefs and Ideas.

- Briefs, also known as Requests for Proposals (RFPs), will be clearly outlined projects that we (i.e. core team) would like to see implemented.
    - We accept applications to tackle briefs from multiple individuals and teams. Every brief will have a budget allocated to it that will be assigned to the best idea. The Core Team will be in charge of voting what the best ideas is.
- Ideas, also known as open Applications. These will follow the same process, but the funding decisions will be made by the Grants Committee. Project Ideas is a more exploratory territory that Project Briefs, it is therefore funded in Protein, inviting the community to tackle collective challenges to feature in the seasonal report.

The entire application process will be made public on the Grants Committee Wiki page.

  Projects that are not funded in USDC but that are funded in PRTN, will always be eligible to Retro active funding in USDC that will be proportional to the financial gain produced by the seasonal report.

No matter the source of the project idea, Protein Projects consists of two main components, briefs and ideas, that share some common guidelines but also have their unique features.

- Projects must align with the goal set by Protein Projects
- Projects must have a clear timeline and deliverables
- Projects must focus on generating marketable outcomes, impact, and cultural value for our community
- Projects should be designed for teams or initiatives rather than individuals
- Projects should have sustainable plans for long-term success.
- A project that aims to be **self-sustaining** and **maintained** for the long run will shine above others. We would love nothing more than to have a Protein grant act as seed funding for projects that create value well beyond the grant's initial window.
- Your project is manifesting **Good Growth**. It ideally contributes to some core Protein values and reflects a deep empathy for others working in web3. This includes understanding of the importance of regenerative thinking, documentation, composability, inclusivity, and basic governance principles.
- You have **strong and relevant** experience. We're looking for pros who have a proven track record in whatever workstreams and tooling are needed to get a project past the finish line.
- We will not fund projects that support any illicit activity (gambling, money laundering, etc.)
- Projects must have at least one lead. This individual will serve as the main point of contact for anyone to reach out to regarding the Project.

The Core team will review and assess proposals and ideas based on how they follow these guidelines and how they embody Protein's values
