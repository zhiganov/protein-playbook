## Feedback form

A feedback survey commissioned by the pastoral council. This is anonymous, you donâ€™t have to give your name or contact, and will be used for internal purposes only to try and improve things. 
The form is [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfRSbucuNpg9_c0HlGPtKuQva4SVaGjY_-PhGtfgrGfF14g4g/viewform), please use! Please share! 

## Rubbish
Goes out to the alley way before the laundry area at any given time
Goes out to the street at specific times which are listed on the wall by the kitchen counter (by the door to the living room)
Bin bags live in the cupboard closest to the floor under the the kitchen counter (by the door to the living room)

## Washing & drying
* 30 min cycle
* Then run on dry only cycle
* 	Left two machines
* Dry only button - 300 to ten ins
* Sunshine with the no wash symbol

## Event space
Primarily used for public or commercial events. Can be used for hosting events by residents but dates need to be coordinated with Ed (& Declan) who hold the calendar. 
Check that it is actually in the calendar and that Declan knows.

## Cleaning
Blessed Saint Luciana comes every weekday, and cleans the common areas, bathrooms & terrace
Residents can vacuum their rooms and the corridors, please return the vacuum to the landing bc Luciana needs to know where it is each morning. 

## Fridges

## Fire

## Ration Club
Guests arrive on Wednesdays at 6pm, sign up to cook on chalkboard on the back of the door in the living room. Cook for between 15 and 30 people?

If you want to announce what you are cooking or ask people to bring anything, use [the FB group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/774912639274152), the newspeak channels on the megastructure slack.

### Leftovers
We tend to waste a lot if not careful! Please make sure that left overs are put in tupperware and go in the guest fridge labelled with a date on. 
If there are more leftovers that will be eaten by the house, please make sure to put them out on the street.
