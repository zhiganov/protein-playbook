# Project Ideas Application & Review

To create the conditions to cultivate ideas it is necessary to follow the following steps: 

1. Proposal template: Fill out the proposal template with the details of your project. The more details you include, the less time we’ll spend on making the decision.
2. Share your proposal: Head over to the #project-ideas channel (in a thread), publish your proposal, invite community members to comment on it, and show their support ( ➕ upvotes) and/or will to contribute. Proposals must get at least 10 upvotes and be open for 3 weeks.
3. The committee and community members may ask questions there. Please answer them in a timely manner. If you don't respond within 2 weeks, we may close the proposal thread due to inactivity.
4. When the prior requirements are met, to apply for a grant you must scope your project in a formal proposal through this form. 

[Grant Submission Form]

Unless further discussion is warranted, we will approve or reject applications within 2 weeks.

Grants Committee may invite a representative of the next Committee call to speak on behalf of the project.

Once approved, the application is "successful" and formal multi-sig vote + payment will be made ASAP.
